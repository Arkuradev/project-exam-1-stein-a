## Future Enhancements

If I had more time on the assignment and this was a project I was doing on my own I would look into the following:

- Include search and filter options.

## My own opinion

This was a challenging but fun project where I learned alot more about API interactions and how they work,
with that in mind I did have some challenges early on with figuring out how to handle the authentication.
But when that got handled everything started flowing very well throughout the rest of the assignment.

I feel like I'm starting to see a pattern now that I have had more then 1 assignment with API interaction, and the process is starting to get more familiar to me.
I'm looking forward to learn more and use more tools to develop better looking websites.

I hope whoever reads this and checks out the website has a joyful experience reviewing and testing out its
functionality.

Enjoy blogging with GamerBlog! ðŸŽ®
